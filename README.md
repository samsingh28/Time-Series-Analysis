#  Time Series Analysis for Stock Prediction
The main goalof this project was to demonstrate the ability of models to generate predictions from a data set. 
The data set in this project included data from Home Depot. This project makes use of a data set that contains stock prices along with variables such as daily high, daily low, volume, etc. My main goal in this project was to use different models to demonstrate the performance of these models and to judge these models on the basis of the accuracy of their predictions.

I made use of the following models:
1. Linear Regression.
2. Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA).
3. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).
